# huffman
Huffman codes are a widely used and very effective technique for compressing data; saving of 20% to 90% are typical,
depending on the characteristics of the data being compressed.

Huffmand's greedy algorithm uses a table of the frequencies of occurrence or the characters to build up an optimal way of
representing each character as a binary string.
